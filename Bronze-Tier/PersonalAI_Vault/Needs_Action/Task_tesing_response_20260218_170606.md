**Urgency:** 🟡 NORMAL
**Summary:** A team meeting is scheduled for next Monday at 2pm to discuss the new website design. The sender requests preparation of mockups before the meeting.

## Raw AI Analysis:
This is a standard meeting notification with a preparation task. The urgency level is NORMAL because:
- Contains keyword "meeting" which maps to NORMAL urgency per Rule 3
- No urgent keywords present (no "ASAP", "urgent", "deadline", or "payment")
- Task has a clear deadline (next Monday) but allows sufficient preparation time
- Action item is straightforward: create mockups for website design discussion

The item requires human action (preparing mockups) but does not need immediate attention within 1 hour. Classification: 🟡 NORMAL — Needs attention today.
