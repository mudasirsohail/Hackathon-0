## Raw AI Analysis:
The item contains the keyword "meeting" which maps to NORMAL urgency per Rule 3 classification guidelines. While the word "Urgent" appears at the start, it's used as a subject line indicator rather than indicating true time-sensitive urgency (no ASAP, deadline, or payment-related content). The action required is agenda preparation for a scheduled meeting, which is a routine task that should be completed before the Friday 3pm meeting. No external API calls or communications are needed per Rule 2 - this is purely an informational classification with a recommended action for human follow-up.
