I see file write permissions are restricted. Per **Rule 2** of the Company Handbook (Human Approval for External Actions), I need approval before writing files.

Here is my structured triage response for the inbox item:

---

```

**Urgency:** 🟢 LOW

**Recommended Action:** Confirm receipt and verify that the file was successfully processed through the triage system.

## Raw AI Analysis:
The inbox item "pathtest.txt" contains a simple test message: "Test: Does the new vault path work?"

Classification reasoning:
- No urgency keywords detected (no "urgent", "ASAP", "deadline", "payment")
- No normal-priority keywords (no "meeting", "task", "follow up", "reminder")
- Content is purely informational/testing in nature
- Assigned LOW priority as it appears to be a system verification test

This item serves as a path validation test for the Personal AI Vault system. The successful reading and processing of this file confirms the vault paths are functioning correctly.

**Pending Actions (awaiting approval):**
1. Write response file to `/Needs_Action/response_pathtest.txt`
2. Update `Dashboard.md` with this processing entry
3. Append entry to `Logs/watcher.log`

Shall I proceed with these file operations?
