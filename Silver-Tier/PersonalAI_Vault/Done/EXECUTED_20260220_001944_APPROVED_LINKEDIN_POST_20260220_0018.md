## Post Content:
🚀 Just completed the Silver Tier of Hackathon 0 at Governor House!

Built an intelligent automation system that works 24/7 without breaking a sweat. Here's what went down:

✅ Gmail Watcher that monitors important emails automatically
✅ WhatsApp Watcher detecting urgent keywords in real-time
✅ Human-in-the-loop approval workflow for safe execution
✅ LinkedIn auto-posting powered by Qwen AI
✅ Approval Handler that executes actions after human review
✅ Windows Task Scheduler keeping everything running on autopilot

The tech stack? Python, Qwen CLI, Playwright, Gmail API, and Obsidian for knowledge management.

What makes this special? Every action requires human approval before execution. No rogue AI running wild. You stay in control while the system handles the heavy lifting.

This hackathon pushed me to think about AI agents differently - not as replacements, but as force multipliers that amplify human decision-making.

Huge thanks to the Governor House team for organizing an incredible event. The learning, the building, the late nights - all worth it when you see your agent actually working.

Already excited for the next tier. Who's building with AI agents right now? Let's connect and share what you're working on!
