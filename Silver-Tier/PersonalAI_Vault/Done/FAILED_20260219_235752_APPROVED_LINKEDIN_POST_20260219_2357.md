## Post Content:
🚀 Just wrapped up the Silver Tier of Hackathon 0 at Governor House!

Built an AI-powered automation system that works 24/7 without breaking a sweat. Here's what went down:

✅ Gmail Watcher that monitors important emails automatically
✅ WhatsApp Watcher detecting urgent keywords in real-time
✅ Human-in-the-loop approval workflow for safe execution
✅ LinkedIn auto-posting powered by Qwen AI
✅ Approval Handler that executes actions after human review
✅ Windows Task Scheduler keeping everything running on autopilot

The best part? Everything runs autonomously once set up. No constant monitoring, no manual triggers—just smart automation that respects human oversight when it matters.

Huge thanks to the Governor House team for organizing this. Learned a ton about building production-ready AI agents, working with Gmail API, Playwright for browser automation, and integrating Qwen CLI into real workflows.

This hackathon pushed me to think beyond "does it work?" to "does it work reliably at 3 AM?" That's the real challenge in building AI systems people can trust.

Already excited for what's next. Build, learn, repeat. 💪
