## What if your business had an employee that never sleeps?

I've been building something that honestly scares me a little — in the best way.

An AI employee that watches my Gmail and WhatsApp 24/7, triages what matters, drafts responses, and even writes LinkedIn posts like this one. But here's the twist: it can't do anything without my approval.

Every email it wants to send, every post it wants to publish — lands in an approval folder first. I rename the file to APPROVED or REJECTED, and it acts accordingly. No surprises. No rogue AI moments.

The real insight? **Automation isn't about replacing yourself. It's about creating a force multiplier that amplifies your judgment, not replaces it.**

I'm seeing 3x more incoming opportunities because nothing slips through the cracks anymore. The AI catches the urgent stuff at 3 AM. I wake up, review what it found, approve what makes sense, and move forward.

Human-in-the-loop isn't just a safety feature. It's the whole game.

What's your take — would you trust an AI employee to work autonomously, or do you need that approval gate too?
