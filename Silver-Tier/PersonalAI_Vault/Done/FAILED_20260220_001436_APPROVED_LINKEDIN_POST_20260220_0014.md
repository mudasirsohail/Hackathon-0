## Post Content:
🚀 Just wrapped up the Silver Tier of Hackathon 0 at Governor House!

Over the past few days, I built an intelligent automation system that runs 24/7 without any manual intervention. Here's what went into it:

✅ Gmail Watcher – monitors important emails automatically
✅ WhatsApp Watcher – detects urgent keyword messages in real-time
✅ Human-in-the-loop approval workflow – every action gets reviewed before execution
✅ LinkedIn auto-posting – powered by Qwen AI
✅ Approval Handler – executes actions after human review
✅ Windows Task Scheduler – keeps everything running automatically

The entire system is built with Python, Qwen CLI, Playwright, Gmail API, and Obsidian for documentation.

What makes this special? It's not just automation—it's *intelligent* automation with human oversight. No blind actions, no mistakes. Just smart, reviewed execution.

This hackathon pushed me to think beyond scripts and into building production-ready agents that actually solve real problems. The learning curve was steep, but seeing it all come together made it worth it.

Huge thanks to the Governor House team for organizing this and pushing us to build in public. Already excited for what's next! 💪
