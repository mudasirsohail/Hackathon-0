🚀 Just completed the Silver Tier of Hackathon 0 at Governor House!

Over the past few days, I built an intelligent automation system that runs 24/7 without any manual intervention. Here's what went into it:

✅ Gmail Watcher that monitors important emails automatically
✅ WhatsApp Watcher detecting urgent keywords in real-time
✅ Human-in-the-loop approval workflow for executing actions
✅ LinkedIn auto-posting powered by Qwen AI
✅ Approval Handler that executes actions after human review
✅ Windows Task Scheduler integration for seamless automation

The entire system is built with Python, Qwen CLI, Playwright, Gmail API, and Obsidian. What started as an idea to automate repetitive tasks turned into a fully functional AI agent that works around the clock.

The best part? Everything runs automatically once set up. No constant monitoring, no manual triggers – just pure automation with human oversight where it matters most.

Huge thanks to the Governor House team for organizing this hackathon. The experience pushed me to think bigger about what's possible with AI agents and automation.

Already excited for the next tier! 💪
