## Post Content:
Just wrapped up the Silver Tier of Hackathon 0 at Governor House! 🚀

Built an AI-powered automation system that runs 24/7 without breaking a sweat. Here's what went down:

Created a Gmail Watcher that monitors important emails around the clock, paired with a WhatsApp Watcher that detects urgent keyword messages in real-time. The system doesn't just watch though—it acts. Set up an email sending workflow with human-in-the-loop approval, so nothing goes out without review. Added LinkedIn auto-posting powered by Qwen AI to share updates automatically. An Approval Handler ties it all together, executing actions only after human confirmation. And the best part? Windows Task Scheduler runs the entire show automatically.

Tech stack: Python, Qwen CLI, Playwright, Gmail API, and Obsidian for documentation.

This was my first deep dive into building autonomous agents with proper guardrails. The key learning? Automation is powerful, but keeping humans in the loop for critical decisions is non-negotiable.

Huge thanks to the Governor House team for organizing this. Already excited for what's next!
