# /sp.constitution — Silver Tier
## Project: Hackathon 0 — Personal AI Employee (Silver Tier)
## Developer: Student of Governor House
## AI Engine: Qwen CLI
## Builds On: Bronze Tier (must be complete before starting this)

---

## ARTICLE I — PURPOSE

Silver Tier transforms the Bronze AI Employee from a simple file processor
into a real autonomous assistant that watches Gmail and WhatsApp, posts on
LinkedIn, sends emails with human approval, and runs on a schedule automatically.

This constitution governs ALL Silver Tier decisions. Bronze constitution still applies.

```

---

## ARTICLE V — SECURITY LAW (CRITICAL)

1. NEVER commit API keys or credentials to GitHub
2. credentials/ folder MUST have .gitignore blocking it
3. All keys stored in environment variables or credentials/ folder only
4. WhatsApp session data NEVER uploaded to GitHub
5. Gmail OAuth tokens stored locally only

---

## ARTICLE VI — HUMAN APPROVAL LAW

ANY of these actions MUST wait for human approval before executing:
- Sending an email
- Posting on LinkedIn
- Replying to WhatsApp messages
- Any action that reaches the outside world

Approval flow:
1. AI writes proposed action to /Needs_Action/APPROVAL_REQUIRED/
2. File contains: what it wants to do + draft content
3. Human reviews, renames file to APPROVED_xxx.md or REJECTED_xxx.md
4. approval_handler.py detects the rename and executes or discards
